    <div class="project-1"> SWING GUI SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR </div>
    <div class="SC">
        <p>A versatile scientific calculator built for precision and 
            speed, perfect for students and professionals solving 
            complex equations effortlessly</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My mini project is a SWING GUI SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR.</li>
            <li>In this project, I was a team leader and worked on the development phase.</li>
            <li> This includes tasks like design, requirement analysis and creating test plan and code. I monitored and managed the work process, checked progress, and guided the team to achieve better results.</li>
            <li>I chose Java for developing our project because of its excellent features like versatility, platform independence, security features, and OOP concepts.</li>
            <li>Simple Calculator - This allows users to input data and perform basic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. </li>
            <li>Scientific Calculator - It includes functionalities like Exponents, Sign, Square, Square root, Factorial, Log, Natural log (ln), Trigonometric functions, and PI. </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s a GUI-based project using the Swing module to organize all the elements that work under the Scientific Calculator in Java.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="project-2">BREAST CANCER DETECTION USING STREAMLIT FRAMEWORK </div>
    <div class="BC"><p>Developed a Python-based application for breast cancer 
        detection using the Streamlit framework, focusing on 
        predictive analytics and user interaction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this project, I contributed to both the design and coding phases. The design phase is where ideas are planned and organized. In the coding phase, these designs are converted into machine-readable code. </li>
            <li> Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. We used deep learning techniques for the
                detection of breast cancer. Early detection of breast cancer significantly increases the survival rate. Our aim is to
                detect breast cancer early, efficiently, and accurately using the Streamlit framework. </li>
            <li>Our aim is to detect breast cancer early, efficiently, and accurately using the Streamlit framework. </li>
            <li>Our system design phase consists of four modules:</li>
            <li>1. Data Collection 2. Data Pre-Processing 3. Model Implementation 4. Prediction </li>
            <li>We collected data from Kaggle, a platform that provides datasets contributed by companies, students, and alumni. It offers free datasets.</li>
            <li>Data Pre-Processing involves transforming raw data into a clean dataset. This step ensures that any missing values, noisy data, and other inconsistencies are addressed before applying the algorithm.</li>
            <li>We used the VGG16 deep learning algorithm to create the model. In the final prediction:</li>
            <li>If the user selects a histopathology image, the output will indicate whether it is normal or cancerous. </li>
            <li>If the user selects an ultrasound image, the output will indicate whether it is benign, malignant, or normal.</li>
        </ul>
